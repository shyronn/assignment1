        <p class="dropcap">On November 23, 2005, Georgia Aquarium officially opened its doors to the public. As the world’s most magical aquarium, Georgia Aquarium features more animals than any other aquarium in more than ten million gallons of water. Through a path of more than sixty exhibits, the Aquarium tells a global water story, with features modeled after the greatest zoos and aquariums in the world. Each majestic exhibit is designed to inspire, entertain and educate.</p>

        <p>In 1979, Bernie Marcus co-founded The Home Depot, opening its first stores and its headquarters in Atlanta, GA. By revolutionizing the home improvement industry, The Home Depot became one of the fastest growing companies in America. Bernie Marcus knew The Home Depot would not have achieved its full potential without the incredible support of the citizens of Atlanta and Georgia, including customers, associates and stockholders. Marcus desired to give back to the great community of Atlanta through a gift that reached as many different lives as possible, just as The Home Depot has touched the lives of a broad and diverse customer base. In his vision, he also wanted to promote economic impact for the city and state, bring growth and new jobs and help create a destination to inspire visitors to stay - and stay longer.</p>

        <p>In 2003, Marcus announced his gift to the city of Atlanta – the Georgia Aquarium. Due to Marcus’ $250 million gift to Georgia, the Aquarium was able to open debt free.</p>

        <p>One of the Georgia Aquarium’s major goals is to be the leading facility for aquatic animal conservation and research. Our state-of-the-art animal health facility, the Correll Center for Aquatic Animal Health, is 10,000 square feet and was designed by world class veterinarian professionals and conservation organizations. It is the only integration of an aquarium and a veterinarian teaching hospital. On a more global scale, the Georgia Aquarium supports, conducts and leads research on environmental and conservation issues.
Georgia Aquarium is a 501(c)3 organization, and we rely on community support to fund our special programs including education and veterinary services.</p>
